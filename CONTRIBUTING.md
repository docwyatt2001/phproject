Contributing to Phproject
=========================

Thanks for contributing! We have a few basic guidelines for helping us accept your pull requests.

1. New translations should be added on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/phproject) rather than through a pull request.
2. Code should follow these basic standards:
	- Tabs instead of spaces
	- Opening braces on same line
3. New features may be best implemented through [a plugin](http://www.phproject.org/plugins.html) rather than into the core code.
